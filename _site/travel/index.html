<h2 id="transportation">Transportation</h2>

<p>Transportation between conference site, hotels, and activity locations will be
taken care of by the Local Organizing Committee. Most sites are walkable and if
not are accessible via public transportation. There will be volunteer walking
groups going from the hotels to/from the sites in the mornings and evenings at
specific times (as well as directions below). We will also be providing
metrocards for public transportation. There is an interactive map provided that
has all the locations mentioned in the details and also individual maps of each
campus indicating the building locations for the events.</p>

<p>As in any city please use caution. Parks are closed between dusk and dawn so
don’t go in the parks when it is dark. Stay in groups (organized walking groups
provided) on the subway, buses, or walking, especially at night.</p>

<p>On Friday all of the conference events will be on Columbia’s campus. We
encourage students to go to their hotels first if at all possible to check-in
and drop off luggage. The hotels should be able to give you directions to
Columbia or there are directions on this website. If you have to come to
Columbia directly with your bag please let one of the organizers know. We will
walk as a group to the dinner location (Harlem Tavern). After dinner there will
be walking/subway groups back to both hotels or a walking group back to Columbia
for evening activities. After the evening activities walking/subway groups will
return to the hotels for the evening.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning there will be walking groups from both hotels to Barnard.
The conference activities are at Barnard on Saturday morning which is right
across the street from Columbia. After lunch we will move to CCNY.
Transportation between Columbia/Barnard and CCNY on Saturday will be provided
with rented buses. After dinner there will be walking/subway groups back to both
hotels or groups going to the various activities. After the activities there
will be groups going back to both hotels as well.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning there will be walking groups from both hotels to Columbia.
Please plan accordingly about your luggage. All conference activities will be at
Columbia on Sunday.</p>

<h2 id="getting-here">Getting here</h2>

<p>Getting to New York City is rather straightforward. It is a major transportation hub. Travel by rail is probably the easiest for most attendees. Everything is connected via the subway, and you won’t have to worry about parking, which can be completely awful in January if there is some snow piled up.</p>

<p>The conference will take place in Upper Manhattan on each campus, all of which are on the 1 line. Detailed maps will come soon.</p>

<h2 id="by-train">By Train</h2>

<p>New York City has two main rail stations in Midtown: Grand Central Terminal (on the east side) and Penn Station (on the west side). Each is also served by numerous bus and subway lines. Grand Central is served by Metro-North Railroad, which goes to NYC suburbs in New York and Connecticut. Penn Station is served by the following: Long Island Rail Road, a commuter railroad serving Long Island; Amtrak, the US national passenger railroad, serving many points throughout the country; and NJ Transit, a commuter line serving points in New Jersey. You’ll arrive in NY at either Grand Central, or Penn Station:</p>

<h3 id="grand-central-terminal">Grand Central Terminal</h3>

<p>Park Avenue and East 42nd Street (between Lexington and Vanderbilt Avenues)</p>

<p>Grand Central is the main terminal for Metro-North Railroad services. Subway lines here include the 4, 5, 6, 7 and S (shuttle between Grand Central and Times Square). For MTA bus details, visit tripplanner.mta.info.</p>

<h3 id="penn-station">Penn Station</h3>

<p>Seventh to Eighth Avenues, between West 31st and West 33rd Streets
Penn Station is the main terminal for Long Island Rail Road, and a terminal for Amtrak and NJ Transit. Subway lines here include the 1, 2, 3, A, C and E. For MTA bus details, visit tripplanner.mta.info.</p>

<h3 id="rail-services">Rail Services</h3>

<h4 id="amtrak">Amtrak</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.amtrak.com/home">Amtrak</a> is the national passenger railroad of the United States. New York City’s Penn Station is their busiest station in the nation, serving hundreds of thousands of passengers each year. The company offers numerous packages and deals, including special passes allowing international visitors to make multiple stops throughout the country.</p>

<p>800-872-7245, 212-630-6400</p>

<h4 id="long-island-rail-road-lirr">Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://lirr42.mta.info/">LIRR</a> commuter railroad operates out of Penn Station and serves 124 stations in Nassau County, Suffolk County, Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan, transporting some 81 million customers each year. Destinations include the Belmont Park racetrack, Citi Field, Jones Beach, the Hamptons and Montauk.</p>

<p>718-217-5477</p>

<h4 id="metro-north-railroad">Metro-North Railroad</h4>

<p>The second-largest commuter train line in the United States, <a href="http://www.mta.info/mnr">Metro-North</a> operates out of Grand Central Terminal. The historic roots of the operation go back to 1832, when the enterprise was known as the New York &amp; Harlem Railroad, a horsecar line in Lower Manhattan. Today, with 775 miles of track, Metro-North goes to 121 stations (in seven New York State counties—Dutchess, Putnam, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Bronx and New York (Manhattan)—and Connecticut’s New Haven and Fairfield counties).</p>

<p>212-532-4900, 877-690-5114</p>

<h4 id="nj-transit">NJ Transit</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.njtransit.com/">NJ transit</a> features 12 lines in three divisions (Hoboken, Newark and the Atlantic City Rail Line) with frequent service throughout New Jersey (Atlantic City and the Jersey Shore are popular stops) and New York (Rockland and Orange counties)—and, of course, into and out of New York City via Penn Station. For schedules and fares, visit the NJ Transit website.</p>

<p>973-275-5555, TTY 800-772-2287</p>

<h4 id="path-port-authority-trans-hudson">PATH (Port Authority Trans Hudson)</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://www.panynj.gov/path/">PATH</a> provides rapid transit between several stops in New York City, along with locations in Newark, Harrison, Jersey City and Hoboken in New Jersey. Air travelers can connect to the PATH from Newark Liberty International Airport. The service operates from the Penn Station in Newark (not the same as Manhattan’s Penn Station) to Lower and Midtown Manhattan. The PATH’s 33rd Street station (on Sixth Avenue, in Herald Square) in Manhattan is one avenue from Amtrak, Long Island Rail Road and NJ Transit trains at Penn Station.</p>

<p>800-234-PATH</p>

<h2 id="by-bus">By Bus</h2>

<p>There are a number of affordable, convenient bus lines that travel to New York City from around the United States. These include <a href="https://www.boltbus.com/">BoltBus</a>, <a href="https://www.megabus.com/">Megabus</a> and <a href="https://www.greyhound.com/">Greyhound</a>.</p>

<h2 id="by-car">By Car</h2>

<p>Use Google Maps for driving directions to New York City. Also, make sure you know where to park: you may want to use an app like SpotHero to find and compare parking spots and locations.</p>

<h2 id="by-air">By Air</h2>
<p>We expect that most attendees will travel by train, bus or car.  If you are
traveling by air and your travel cost is not covered by your department, your
airfare must be approved by the conference organizers before you book your
travel.</p>
