        <h1 id="getting-here">Getting here</h1>

<p>Getting to New York City is rather straightforward. It is a major transportation hub. Travel by rail is probably the easiest for most attendees. Everything is connected via the subway, and you won’t have to worry about parking, which can be completely awful in January if there is some snow piled up.</p>

<p>The conference will take place in Upper Manhattan on each campus, all of which are on the 1 line. Detailed maps will come soon.</p>

<h2 id="by-train">By Train</h2>

<p>New York City has two main rail stations in Midtown: Grand Central Terminal (on the east side) and Penn Station (on the west side). Each is also served by numerous bus and subway lines. Grand Central is served by Metro-North Railroad, which goes to NYC suburbs in New York and Connecticut. Penn Station is served by the following: Long Island Rail Road, a commuter railroad serving Long Island; Amtrak, the US national passenger railroad, serving many points throughout the country; and NJ Transit, a commuter line serving points in New Jersey. You’ll arrive in NY at either Grand Central, or Penn Station:</p>
