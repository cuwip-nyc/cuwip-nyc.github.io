<h2 id="transportation">Transportation</h2>

<p>Transportation between conference site, hotels, and activity locations will be
taken care of by the Local Organizing Committee. Most sites are walkable and if
not are accessible via public transportation. There will be volunteer walking
groups going from the hotels to/from the sites in the mornings and evenings at
specific times (as well as directions below). We will also be providing
metrocards for public transportation. There is an interactive map provided that
has all the locations mentioned in the details and also individual maps of each
campus indicating the building locations for the events.</p>

<p>As in any city please use caution. Parks are closed between dusk and dawn so
don’t go in the parks when it is dark. Stay in groups (organized walking groups
provided) on the subway, buses, or walking, especially at night.</p>

<p>On Friday all of the conference events will be on Columbia’s campus. We
encourage students to go to their hotels first if at all possible to check-in
and drop off luggage. The hotels should be able to give you directions to
Columbia or there are directions on this website. If you have to come to
Columbia directly with your bag please let one of the organizers know. We will
walk as a group to the dinner location (Harlem Tavern). After dinner there will
be walking/subway groups back to both hotels or a walking group back to Columbia
for evening activities. After the evening activities walking/subway groups will
return to the hotels for the evening.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning there will be walking groups from both hotels to Barnard.
The conference activities are at Barnard on Saturday morning which is right
across the street from Columbia. After lunch we will move to CCNY.
Transportation between Columbia/Barnard and CCNY on Saturday will be provided
with rented buses. After dinner there will be walking/subway groups back to both
hotels or groups going to the various activities. After the activities there
will be groups going back to both hotels as well.</p>

<h2 id="getting-here">Getting here</h2>

<p>Getting to New York City is rather straightforward. It is a major transportation hub. Travel by rail is probably the easiest for most attendees. Everything is connected via the subway, and you won’t have to worry about parking, which can be completely awful in January if there is some snow piled up.</p>

<p>The conference will take place in Upper Manhattan on each campus, all of which are on the 1 line. Detailed maps will come soon.</p>

<h2 id="by-train">By Train</h2>

<p>New York City has two main rail stations in Midtown: Grand Central Terminal (on the east side) and Penn Station (on the west side). Each is also served by numerous bus and subway lines. Grand Central is served by Metro-North Railroad, which goes to NYC suburbs in New York and Connecticut. Penn Station is served by the following: Long Island Rail Road, a commuter railroad serving Long Island; Amtrak, the US national passenger railroad, serving many points throughout the country; and NJ Transit, a commuter line serving points in New Jersey. You’ll arrive in NY at either Grand Central, or Penn Station:</p>
