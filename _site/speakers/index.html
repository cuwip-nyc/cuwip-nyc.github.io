  Her research focuses on studies of the Universe at both the smallest and the largest scales, to probe two questions: What is the Universe made of?  What are the laws of physics that govern the constituents of the Universe? She has held a number of leadership positions in experiments at accelerators that probe the elementary particles and the fundamental interactions.  She is now part of a large international team of scientists preparing for analysis of data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which will provide the most extensive census of the Universe to date. She and her collaborators will use these data to investigate the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the cosmological evolution of the Universe.
  </p>

  <p>
  Patricia Burchat is a “first-gen” high school graduate. She received her Bachelors degree in Engineering Science at University of Toronto in 1981, and her PhD in Physics from Stanford in 1986. She was a postdoc and faculty member at UC Santa Cruz before returning to Stanford as a faculty member in 1995. At Stanford, she has served as Chair of the Physics Department and has been very active in introducing research-based pedagogy in the teaching of physics. She has received the Dean’s Award for Distinguished Teaching and the Walter J. Gores Award for excellence in teaching, and was elected as Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Physical Society. Patricia Burchat has played a leading role in the growth of the APS Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics.

  Professor Mukherjee's research interests are in high-energy astrophysics and astroparticle physics. She uses ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes to study galactic and extragalactic high-energy gamma-ray sources.
</p>
<p>One of her current projects is VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System), located in southern Arizona. VERITAS is a major ground-based gamma-ray observatory that enables the study of extragalactic and galactic high energy gamma-ray sources. The VERITAS collaboration uses an array of mirrors at night to detect the quick flashes of blue Cherenkov light that result from gamma-ray air showers.

evaluating when and where electrostatic interactions are important in proteins. To do this she
uses time-resolved optical spectroscopy to study photosynthetic reaction centers. The aim is to
characterize the energy landscape (reaction barriers and thermodynamics) of electron transfer
reactions that are coupled to protein and proton motions. Her work also includes calculating pKs
and electrochemical midpoints in proteins to see how a protein's form yields its function, and
developing MCCE which combines continuum electrostatics & molecular mechanics to study
coupled conformation & ionization state changes in proteins.

Additionally, she participated in a summer program with Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD; for this project, she works with data from the New Horizons flyby of Pluto to investigate the effects of topography on the movement of ices on Pluto's surface. In addition to research, Briley is involved with Columbia's Undergraduate Astronomy Club, BlueShift, which aims to promote a community between undergraduate students and support their involvement in research and departmental activities. She attended her first CUWiP her sophomore year of undergrad, and is very excited to be helping with this year's conference.
