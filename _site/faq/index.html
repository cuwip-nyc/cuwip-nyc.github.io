<h2 id="what-is-cuwip">What is CUWiP?</h2>

<p>The APS Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) are three-day
regional conferences for undergraduate physics and related majors. The 2018 conferences will be held January 12-14.</p>

<p>The primary goal of the CUWiP conference is to help undergraduate women continue in physics by providing them with the opportunity to experience a professional conference, information about graduate school and professions in physics, and access to other women in physics of all ages with whom they can share experiences, advice, and ideas.</p>

<p>The 2018 program at Columbia University/Barnard College/City College of New York will include research talks, panel discussions about graduate school and careers in physics, workshops and discussions about women in physics, student research talks and poster session, and laboratory tours.</p>

<h4 id="who-is-invited-to-attend-cuwip">Who is invited to attend CUWiP?</h4>

<p>For the last decade, Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) has
helped undergraduate women thrive in physics by providing them a with a unique
opportunity to engage with and learn from other women in physics at all stages
of their physics careers. At CUWiP, budding physicists will experience a
professional conference, learn about graduate school and professions in physics,
and share invaluable experiences, advice, and ideas with other women. Only
undergraduate students who will be over 18 at the time of the conference may
apply to CUWiP. Faculty/mentors who are interested in attending the conference
should contact cuwipnyc@gmail.com to discuss possible participation.</p>

<h2 id="application-and-registration">Application and Registration</h2>

<h4 id="who-can-attend--do-i-need-to-be-a-physics-major-to-apply">Who can attend?  Do I need to be a physics major to apply?</h4>

<p>Any undergraduate student attending a US college/university may apply.</p>

<p>It is very important to complete all parts of the application and to write a thoughtful Applicant Statement. If conferences are oversubscribed, priority will be given to applicants who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are undergraduate physics and related majors</li>
  <li>Have never attended an APS CUWiP</li>
  <li>Are applying to attend the conference that is geographically closest to their expected location January 12-14, 2018.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="are-application-and-registration-the-same-thing">Are “application” and “registration” the same thing?</h4>

<p>No. You <strong>apply</strong> to attend a CUWiP conference (the one closest to you), and you are
accepted, wait-listed or declined according to the priorities listed above.
Application is free, and the deadline is <strong>Friday, October 13, 2017 at 11:59 PM
EDT</strong>. If you are accepted, you then <strong>register</strong> with the conference to which you have been accepted (you may be assigned to a different conference depending on the number of applications) to confirm that you will actually be attending.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-i-know-which-site-to-apply-to">How do I know which site to apply to?</h4>

<p>Please see the <a href="/images/CUWiP2018_Map_Final.png">APS CUWiP map</a>. If you do not apply to the site that you will be geographically closest to at the time of the conference, your application may be denied.</p>

<h4 id="do-i-need-to-book-my-travel-before-registering">Do I need to book my travel before registering?</h4>

<p>No, but you should have an estimate of the cost. We expect that most attendees
will travel by train, bus, or car. If you are traveling by air and your travel cost is not covered by your department, your airfare must be approved by the conference organizers before you book your travel. Due to the limited nature of our travel funds, we ask that you find the most economical means of transportation to and from the conference. For example, reach out to others in your department and see if carpooling is an option.</p>

<h4 id="what-will-increase-my-chances-of-being-accepted-to-the-conference">What will increase my chances of being accepted to the conference?</h4>

<p>First, make sure you submit your application by the deadline. Second, make sure you put some thought into why you want to attend and what you want to get out of the conference. Please answer all questions on the application fully and honestly. Offering to present a talk or a poster will not affect your chances of being selected to attend.</p>

<h2 id="cost-and-funding">Cost and Funding</h2>

<h4 id="how-much-does-the-conference-cost">How much does the conference cost?</h4>

<p>Students who are accepted to attend the conference must pay a one-time registration fee of $45, which helps offset some of the cost of the conference, including all lodging and meals.  If you cannot afford the registration fee and your department/college is unable to help, you may request a fee waiver by submitting a statement attesting to your financial need and verifying that department or university funds are not available.  Further details will be provided when you are invited to register for the conference. You must request a fee waiver at least two days in advance of registering.</p>

<p>Lodging and food will be covered by the conference; you
do not need to pay for your hotel room or food at the conference.  We expect
that your travel expenses will be covered by your home department or college.
However, if they are not able to cover these expenses, travel funding is
available by emailing cuwipnyc@gmail.com with your full name, department, and
a brief email detailing your situation.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-i-know-the-amount-my-department-will-contribute-to-my-travel-funding">How do I know the amount my department will contribute to my travel funding?</h4>

<p>Please talk to your department chair, manager, or director of undergraduate
studies before registering for CUWiP. You might ask an academic advisor, faculty
member you know, or other mentor for guidance about who to ask if you are
unsure.  You can also contact us at cuwipnyc@gmail.com if you would like guidance in asking your department for travel funds.</p>

<h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>

<h4 id="do-i-need-to-have-research-to-present-in-order-to-attend-the-conference">Do I need to have research to present in order to attend the conference?</h4>

<h4 id="i-attended-last-year-can-i-come-to-this-years-conference-too">I attended last year; can I come to this year’s conference, too?</h4>

<p>The content of this year’s conference will not be exactly the same as last year’s, and you are welcome to apply to attend again. However, if more students apply than we can accommodate, preference will be given to students who have never attended a CUWiP.</p>

<h4 id="i-am-a-local-student-do-i-need-to-register">I am a local student. Do I need to register?</h4>

<p>Yes, all attendees must register by the deadline.</p>
