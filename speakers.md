<h2>Dr. Emmy Noether</h2>
<h4>Bryn Mawr</h4>
<p >Noether's work in abstract algebra and topology was influential in mathematics, while in physics, Noether's theorem has far-ranging consequences for theoretical physics and dynamic systems. She showed an acute propensity for abstract thought, which allowed her to approach problems of mathematics in fresh and original ways. Her friend and colleague Hermann Weyl described her scholarly output in three epochs:</p>

<ol>
<li>the period of relative dependence, 1907–1919;</li>
<li>the investigations grouped around the general theory of ideals 1920–1926;</li>

<li>the study of the non-commutative algebras, their representations by linear transformations, and their application to the study of commutative number fields and their arithmetics.
</li>
