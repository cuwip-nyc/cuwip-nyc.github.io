<h2>Professor Patricia Burchat</h2>
<h4>Stanford University</h4>
<h5>APS CUWiP Keynote Speaker</h5>

<p>

Patricia Burchat is the <a href="https://physics.stanford.edu/people/faculty/patricia-burchat">Gabilan Professor in the Physics Department at Stanford University</a>. Her research focuses on studies of the Universe at both the smallest and the largest scales, to probe two questions: What is the Universe made of?  What are the laws of physics that govern the constituents of the Universe? She has held a number of leadership positions in experiments at
accelerators that probe the elementary particles and the fundamental interactions.  She is now part of a large international team of scientists preparing for analysis of data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which will provide the most extensive census of the Universe to date. She and her collaborators will use these data to investigate the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the cosmological evolution of the Universe.
