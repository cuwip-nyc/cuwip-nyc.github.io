  <h2><a name="topicTables" class="anchor">Lunchtime Topic Tables</a></h2>
  <p>Time: 12pm, Saturday</p>
  <p>Location: Event Oval in the Diana Center (lower level 1), Barnard College</p>
  <p>Have a casual chat over lunch on any of the following topics: </p>

  <ol>
  <li><h4>Applying Skills Acquired in Physics to Other Fields</h4>
  <h5>Emma Jablonski, Software Developer, D.E. Shaw research</h5>
  <p>The focus of this table is to provide insights into how a background in physics can open the door to a variety of professional opportunities. We will discuss how the analytical and coding skills developed through an undergraduate physics degree prepare students for careers in various industries.</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Astronomy/Astrophysics as a Career Path</h4>
  <h5>Mary Putman, Professor, Columbia Astronomy </h5>
  <p>Interested in studying celestial objects as a paid position? We will discuss the typical path to becoming an Astrophysicist/Astronomer and the job prospects in the field.</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Exoplanets and Data Science</h4>
  <h5>Ruth Angus, Postdoc, Columbia Astronomy</h5>
  <p>Searching for planets orbiting distant stars may sound thrilling, and it is, but you may not know that it's basically data science. From munging (cleaning up imperfect data sets) to modeling (doing the science bit), it all involves data manipulation. I'll discuss the realities of exoplanet science and the skills you'll learn if planets are your passion. Data scientists are sought after in industry too, so if you want a job at Netflix or Amazon, planet hunting might just get you there.
</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Modeling the Universe</h4>
  <h5>Tjitske Starkenburg (postdoc, CCA), Greg Bryan (Columbia Faculty) </h5>
  <p>Creating models to explain observations is at the heart of astronomy, and we are in the midst of a revolution in the detail and realism of those models, as well as the data they need to match. We will discuss the opportunities and challenges of this field.
</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics</h4>
  <h5>Stan Kondov, Postdoc, Columbia Physics</h5>
  <p>	Please join for broad discussion of life in AMO: atmosphere in the community, challenges of graduate school, and career prospects.
</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Going from Physics to the Mathematical and Computational Sciences</h4>
  <h5>Kyle Mandli, Professor, Columbia Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics</h5>
  <p>	Physics and mathematics have always held close ties to each other so it is natural to consider which field might be best for your graduate work and further career.  The discussion will include what kind of things such as transition entails and the likelihood that you will be able to pursue physics problems in these fields.  
</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>How To Give a Compelling Physics Talk</h4>
  <h5>David Helfand, Professor and Chair, Columbia Astronomy
</h5>
  <p>Being able to captivate an audience with your presentation is an essential skill for advancing any career. Learn some simple do's and don'ts for constructing a compelling talk on physics (or any other topic)
</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Using physics in the Financial industry</h4>
  <h5>Greg Kaldor, Managing Director, Global Equities, Bank of America</h5>
  <h5>Chidinma Iwueke, Associate, Global Research, Bank of America</h5>
  <p></p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>A Physics career in Industry</h4>
  <h5>Kathryn Guarini & Heike Riel (IBM) </h5>
  <p>Please join us for a dialog about opportunities and challenges of a physics career in industry with two physicists who have played various technical and leadership roles at IBM.
</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Alternative Careers for STEM majors: work at National Labs</h4>
  <h5>Vivian Stojanoff and members of Brookhaven Women in Science, Brookhaven National Lab</h5>
  <p></p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Strategies for Thriving as a Person-of-Color in Physics</h4>
  <h5>Moiya McTier, Graduate Student, Columbia Astronomy</h5>
  <p>It's no secret that people of color are underrepresented in STEM careers, and the numbers for women of color are so small that the statistics are almost meaningless. At this topic table, we'll discuss practical strategies for making it through the so-called STEM pipeline so that future generations of scientists can be more representative of the nation's population.
</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>LGBTQIA+ in Physics</h4>
  <h5>Mel Abler (Columbia grad), Charlotte Olsen (Rutgers grad)</h5>
  <p>What challenges do we face when navigating a physics degree through the lens of gender/sexual identity? What methods should we use that we — as well as those that come after us —  may feel welcome and included? Where is there still a need for improvement in our departments and in the field in general? How does our own intersectionality make us better advocates? Let’s talk. All are welcome. 
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>First generation/low income college students</h4>
  <h5>	Kirsten Blancato, Graduate Student, Columbia Astronomy
</h5>
  <p>	Being a first-generation and/or low-income college student in physics/astronomy can be a challenging and isolating experience. In addition to a lack of knowledge of the unspoken rules of higher education, many first-gen/low-income college students experience guilt about leaving their families behind. Together, let's discuss strategies for navigating the culture of academia as a first-gen/low-income student, while at the same time maintaining a connection to family back home. 
</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Strategies that increase sense of belonging and confidence in low-diversity fields</h4>
  <h5>Susan Meabh Kelly, Research Associate, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies 
</h5>
  <p>"Imposter syndrome" and  "stereotype threat" are hot topics of study in the nation's efforts to create a more diverse and inclusive STEM workforce.  At this table we will discuss strategies to deflate these obstacles, as established by scientists working in low-diversity fields, federal agencies, professional science organizations, and sociological research.  Unique, empowering opportunities embedded within these challenges will be identified and discussed.</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Work Life Balance</h4>
  <h5>Jacquelyn Noronha-Hostler, Assistant Professor, Rutgers Physics
</h5>
  <p>Balancing work-life can be challenging in physics when it comes to pregnancy, parenting, care-giving, living abroad (especially in a new language!), and the two-body problem (balancing two academic careers).  We will  discuss strategies on maintaining a career while also juggling life outside of physics. 

</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Life as a graduate student</h4>
  <h5>Catie Raney (Rutgers grad)</h5>
  <p>As an undergraduate, you may wonder whether graduate school is the right next step for you, and how to get there if it is. We will discuss what you can do with a higher degree, how it compares to undergrad, and typical day-to-day life as a graduate student. For those who have already decided it's the right path, we'll also discuss the application process, getting into a good program for your interests, and what to ask on grad school visits.
</p>

  <h2><a name="stepUp" class="anchor">Step Up for Women</a></h2>

  <h3>Direct action to increase women in physics: How you can help change the physics community</h3>
  <p>Time: 4 pm, Saturday</p>
  <p>Location: Steinman Auditorium, CCNY</p>
  <div class="well">
    <p>
   While nearly half of the students taking physics in high school are women, only one third of the students interested in physics majors in college are women. How can you help to change this pattern?  Physics education researchers have developed two high school physics class lessons that have been shown to increase the interest of high school women in physics careers. Join us to learn about this exciting program to help high school teachers encourage women to pursue physics careers and  how you can help change the way high school students view their future in physics.

  <p>Time: 9:00 am- 9:45, Sunday, 1/14</p>
  <p>Location: Columbia University</p>
  <div class="well">
    <h4>My methodical approach to finding professional success and personal happiness</h4>
    <p>I would like to share with you the methods that I have used to identify my dream job as an academic scientist and to guide my personal and professional choices. I will present this framework in a way which individuals could potentially adapt to their own situation and life goals. The framework is adaptable for all career paths and it just so happens that in my case, being a professor was the best solution given my constraints. I will further describe some of the philosophies which have helped me to find both success and happiness as a woman in a patriarchal profession.</p>
