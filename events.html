<p>Saturday Morning: 8:30 am - 9:30 am &amp; 11 am - 12 pm</p>
<p>Location: Barnard College</p>

<h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>

<p>Faculty who run undergraduate research programs at Columbia, City College, and Barnard are here to tell you what they look for in students and how to succeed in a lab.  Undergraduates currently working in labs will also be on the panel to share their experiences and tips.
</p>


<h3>Underrepresented in STEM</h3>

<p>Come hear from people across a wide spectrum of identities about their experiences in academia, programs and groups designed to support underrepresented groups, and more!</p>

<h3>Navigating Professional Spaces</h3>

<p>At this session you will learn about how to network and navigate professional spaces, including the world of academia. Our speaker, Celia Lloyd, will guide you through leadership development activities and give you tips on how to find a mentor.</p>

<h3>Grad School</h3>

<p>Hear from a panel of faculty and graduate students who have either served on selection committees or have won fellowships themselves.  After a brief introduction, the panel will be open for questions and give you their pro tips for getting in to graduate school and being competitive in fellowship applications.</p>

<h3>Mental Wellness</h3>

<p>What to do when your brain lies to you? In this workshop we present a research based understanding of the causes of mental stress and how to deal with them. We talk about stereotype-threat, imposter syndrome, self-care, and share our personal stories about mental health in academia and beyond. You will learn about resources and do activities that allow you to prioritize and take care of your mental health.</p>

<h3>Careers Tangential to Physics</h3>

<p>Hear from women with undergraduate or graduate physics degrees about how they pivoted the skills they learned in school to work in industries including finance, consulting, data science, education, and more!  Each panelist will give a brief introduction to their background and current work, with the rest of the time open for your questions.</p>
