## What is CUWiP?

The APS Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) are three-day
regional conferences for undergraduate physics and related majors. The 2018 conferences will be held January 12-14.  

The primary goal of the CUWiP conference is to help undergraduate women continue in physics by providing them with the opportunity to experience a professional conference, information about graduate school and professions in physics, and access to other women in physics of all ages with whom they can share experiences, advice, and ideas.

The 2018 program at Columbia University/Barnard College/City College of New York will include research talks, panel discussions about graduate school and careers in physics, workshops and discussions about women in physics, student research talks and poster session, and laboratory tours.


If you are:

- Interested in meeting other women in physics?
- Looking for new experiences, advice, and ideas?
- Excited to learn about graduate school and professions in physics?

Then join us for APS CUWiP January 12-14, 2018!

#### Code of Conduct for APS Meetings

It is the policy of the American Physical Society (APS) that all participants, including atendees, vendors, APS staff, volunteers, and all other stakeholders at APS meetings will conduct themselves in a professional manner that is welcoming to all participants and free from any form of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. Participants will treat each other with respect and consideration to create a collegial, inclusive, and professional environment at APS Meetings. Creating a supportive environment to enable scientific discourse at APS meetings is the responsibility of all participants.

Participants will avoid any inappropriate actions or statements based on individual characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, nationality, political affiliation, ability status, educational background, or any other characteristic protected by law. Disruptive or harassing behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. Harassment includes but is not limited to inappropriate or intimidating behavior and language, unwelcome jokes or comments, unwanted touching or attention, offensive images, photography without permission, and stalking.

Violations of this code of conduct policy should be reported to meeting organizers, APS staff, or the APS Director of Meetings. Sanctions may range from verbal warning, to ejection from the meeting without refund, to notifying appropriate authorities. Retaliation for complaints of inappropriate conduct will not be tolerated. If a participant observes inappropriate comments or actions and personal intervention seems appropriate and safe, they should be considerate of all parties before intervening.
