## What is CUWiP?

The APS Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) are three-day
regional conferences for undergraduate physics and related majors. The 2018 conferences will be held January 12-14.  

The primary goal of the CUWiP conference is to help undergraduate women continue in physics by providing them with the opportunity to experience a professional conference, information about graduate school and professions in physics, and access to other women in physics of all ages with whom they can share experiences, advice, and ideas.

The 2018 program at Columbia University/Barnard College/City College of New York will include research talks, panel discussions about graduate school and careers in physics, workshops and discussions about women in physics, student research talks and poster session, and laboratory tours.


If you are:

- Interested in meeting other women in physics?
- Looking for new experiences, advice, and ideas?
- Excited to learn about graduate school and professions in physics?

Then join us for APS CUWiP January 12-14, 2018!
