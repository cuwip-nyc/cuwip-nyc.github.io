    <p>
      Registration for the conference can only happen after you have received a notice from the APS that you have been accepted. Please apply only to the conference closest to your geographic location on January 14th, 2018. The application period is September 1 to Oct 13, 2017, and you will be informed of your acceptance by the end of November 2017.
    </p>


<br /><br />

    <p>
      If you are accepted, you will be asked to register, also through a central APS site. Upon registration, you will be asked to pay a $45 registration fee. Lodging, food, and tours will be provided to all student attendants by the conference. In case the conference is over-subscribed, hotel accommodation preference will be given to non-local students. We encourage you to ask your department to help you with travel expenses.
